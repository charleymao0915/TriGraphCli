# TriGraphCli
TriGraph is a encryption method used by the U.S. Special Forces widely since Vietnam War. It utilizes the One-Time-Pad concept.
It is very similar to the Diana Cryptosystem. Please check out https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad and 
Diana Cryptosystem online to learn more.
The TriGraphCli is a fun project to simplify the process of encryting and decrypting trigraph messages. 
It takes a long time to do these by hands and it is very easy to make mistakes. This console program will make it easier!
